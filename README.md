# FlipStacks
FlipStacks is a new flashcard app for iPhone, iPad and Mac[^1]. It's built with pure SwiftUI and SwiftData, so it runs blazingly fast and has easy to read code. The code is licensed under MPL2.0, the same license used for [HappyWork](https://github.com/libewa/hausaufgaben), so feel free to improve it.

## Downloads
At the moment, the encouraged method for installing FlipStacks is cloning the git repository to a Mac and building it with Xcode. This is possible with the free developer account (now called just Apple Developer)you can set up with any non-restricted Apple ID, however you will not be able to use CloudKit, and will need to re-sign the app every ten days by connecting to your Mac (which you can luckily also do over WiFi).

### TestFlight
TestFlight access will be provided here once Apple approves my first build.

### App Store
An App Store link will be provided here once the app gets released.
